INTRODUCTION
============

This is informixdb 2.1, an Informix implementation of the Python
Database API.  This release implements version 2.0 of the DB-API:

  http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html

The module consists of two components:

- `_informixdb', a Python C extension that interfaces with INFORMIX-ESQL/C
  and implements the DB-API.
- `informixdb', a Python module that wraps around _informixdb and implements
  various helper classes.

It is released under a BSD-like license.  See the COPYRIGHT file
included with this distribution for more details.


INSTALLATION (UNIX)
===================

This distribution uses Python distutils to build and install the informixdb
module.  It requires Python 2.2 or later.


In a hurry?
-----------

Extract the source distribution, and `cd' to the top-level directory.
Type `python setup.py build_ext' and, as root, `python setup.py install'.

Or want the details?
--------------------

First, extract the source distribution on a machine with Python 2.2 or
later and INFORMIX-ESQL/C, and `cd' to the top-level directory.

Next, run the build script `python setup.py build_ext', giving it any of the
following build options:

  --esql-informixdir=DIR

  Look for INFORMIX-ESQL/C in `DIR'.  If omitted, it defaults to the value
  of the INFORMIXDIR environment variable, or else /usr/informix.

  --esql-static

  Disable the use of Informix shared libraries.  The default is to use
  shared libraries if available.  With this option, you can require
  the Informix static libraries to instead be used.

  --esql-threadlib=LIB

  Enable the use of thread-safe Informix libraries, so that multiple Python
  threads can use informixdb concurrently.

If the build command completes without errors, type `python setup.py install',
which will install the package into the appropriate site-specific library path.


INSTALLATION (Win32)
====================

A Windows installer for Python 2.4 is available for download at
http://informixdb.sourceforge.net/. Download it and run it to install
the InformixDB module. Note that you'll need the Informix Client SDK
to use the InformixDB module.

If you're using a different version of Python, you'll have to compile
InformixDB from the sources, following the same steps as for a Unix
installation. Distutils should do the right thing as long as you have the same
compiler that produced the Python interpreter you're using.


NEWS
====

From 2.0 to 2.1:
- INTERVAL support
- Scroll cursor and cursor with hold
- Support for Smart Large Objects and User Defined Types

From 1.5 to 2.0:

- Full compliance with DB-API version 2
- Implement LVARCHAR support
- Use insert cursor, if possible, in executemany for improved performance.

From 1.4 to 1.5:

- Further steps towards DB-API 2 compliance:
  * added recommended keyword arguments to connect() method
  * implemented cursor methods/attributes .next(), .executemany(),
    .rowcount, and .arraysize
- informixdb.Error now makes details about the error (such as sqlcode)
  available as attributes.
- sqlerrd wasn't initialized properly, and under many circumstances it
  didn't correspond to the most recent operation. (Specifically,
  it didn't get updated after PREPARE, OPEN, or FETCH.)
  
From 1.3 to 1.4:

- Ported from "Makefile.pre.in" mechanism to distutils.
- Allow passing username and password for connecting to remote databases.
- Expose sqlerrd.
- Trivial baby steps towards DB-API version 2 compliance.

From 1.2 to 1.3:

- Fixed the `fetch{one|many|all}' method output types and/or values
  for several SQL types.  See ChangeLog for more info.

From 1.01 to 1.2:

- `informixdb' now exports `error' as a module global.  It previously
  was only available as a connection attribute.

- The `execute' method for connections now returns a value.  It
  previously returned `None'.

- The `execute' method no longer limits operation strings to 2000
  characters or less.  Strings longer than this used to cause stack
  corruption.

- `None' is mapped to NULL for `execute' method inputs.
  Previously, it was mapped to the literal string "None".

- NULLS are mapped to `None' for `fetch{one|many|all}' method outputs.
  Previously, they were mapped to either zero or an empty string.
  (This fix can be disabled by setting the IFXDB_MASK_NULLS environment
  variable to a non-zero value.  See ChangeLog for more info.)

- Fixed error message formatting.

- Potentially blocking SQL statements are now executed with the Python
  interpreter lock released.  This permits other threads to execute
  while one blocks on a database request.

- Increased the maximum number of rows returned by the `fetchall'
  method from 65536 to `sys.maxint'.

- Fixed a bug that caused raw (i.e., BYTE or TEXT) inputs to
  occasionally be treated as NULLs.

- Fixed a bug that caused datetime outputs with YEAR TO MINUTE
  precision to be wildly inaccurate.

- Reorganized the source files as follows:

- Fixed numerous memory leaks.

- Added support for thread-safe Informix, so that each thread can open its
  own connections.

- Implemented the "operation caching" feature of the `execute' method,
  as described in the DB-API spec.  If the same operation string is
  passed consecutively to `execute' (perhaps with different inputs
  each time), informixdb now recognizes this condition and uses the
  previously parsed/prepared/described SQL statement.

For complete details, refer to the ChangeLog file included with this
distribution.

NOTES
=====

- If informixdb is built to use Informix shared libraries, you may
  need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or similar environment variable) so that
  the runtime linker can locate these shared libraries.  Otherwise, you
  may get the following exception when importing the informixdb module:

    ImportError: Cannot locate C core module for informix db interface.

- In the operation string argument of the `execute' method, informixdb
  recognizes not only positional parameters (i.e., identified by '?'
  characters) but also ordinal parameters (i.e., identified by ":N"
  substrings, where N is a number from 1 to M corresponding to the Nth
  item in the parameter M-tuple).

See also `old/README' for other NOTES.


FUTURE
======

- Nothing planned at the moment. Let me know if you think a feature is missing.
